                <li>My main goal is to change the world to better condition. <br>
                    I like to gain a new knowleges, thats why i start 'rolling-scope' course. <br>
                    I never had experience in programming before, this course is challenge for me. Why i start it? <br>
                    In august i drink beer with my old friend - he is teacher and programmer same time. <br>
                    I tell him about my idea of service for truck drivers. We discuss it. <br>
                    So, one moment he ask me: Why you not try to do it by yourself, this is good experience? its not too difficult.<br>
                    I ask myself: why not? I often born an ideas in my mind and i decide this would be very useful skills. <br>
                    Especially i always thought that programming is the most difficult thing among 'thinking professions'. <br>
                    I worked engineer over 5 years, also i was businessman more than 8 years <br>
                    (I was truck owner, i had a night club, later several points of street food and rock bar finely).<br>
                    I can create poetry, I read books.</li>
                <li>I dont have skills in programming</li>
                <li>not yet</li>
                <li>not yet</li>
                <li>UdSU economist, UdSU english teacher (not enough practice in this point), law courses. <br>
                    Im not a humanitarian at the 100%, i started as physicist but after two years of study and my first work i moved to economic faculty. </li>
                <li>I thought my english better, but test shows that i have only A+ level. <br>
                        My weakness is a grammar and some special words probably but i can catch the main theme and make a respond. </li>
